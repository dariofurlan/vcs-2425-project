To find out if some architectures are more prone to depth images than some others we tested on the same dataset different algorithms of image classification:

- AlexNet (this is interesting because it can be our baseline, we may report it or not we'll see)
- VGG16 and/or VGG19
- ResNet50 and ResNet??






- Inception
- DenseNet
- MobileNet
- ViT (probably too complex cause it requires HUGE dataset to train well)
