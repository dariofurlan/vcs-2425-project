\section{Introduction}
Today, computer vision is highly advanced and even able to surpass human-level cognitive performance in a wide range of tasks, ranging from image classification to object detection, image segmentation, and more. However, most of these models rely on RGB images, which put privacy at risk in settings such as hospitals, retirement homes, and child or elderly care centers, where the protection of vulnerable individuals is of critical importance.

To address this concern, we explored a promising alternative: depth images; which are captured by 3D cameras, preserving the spatial structure needed for visual recognition without sacrificing privacy.

In this paper, our experiments solely focus on image classification, which we regard as the building block to the broader spectrum of computer vision challenges, thereby laying a foundation for future work and extensions.
